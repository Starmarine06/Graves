Tired of that heart-sinking feeling when you die in Minecraft, frantically scrambling to retrieve your scattered items before they despawn or fall into lava? Wishing there was a reliable way to recover your hard-earned gear without the stress of a timed race against the clock? Perhaps you've dreamt of a dignified and simple method to reclaim your inventory, no matter how treacherous your demise?

This datapack is exactly what you need! It adds graves that spawn at your death location. When you perish, a special grave block appears, safely storing all your items. Simply return to your grave, crouch over it, and effortlessly retrieve everything you lost.
